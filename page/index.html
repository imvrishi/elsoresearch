			<p>Surveys are perhaps the easiest place to start and the most widely known and utilized method when it comes to market research. For survey market research to be successful, the questionnaire needs to be spot on and the sample size needs to be as large as required for the target market. We can help you measure something objectively, beyond the exploratory portion of your research and test more specific questions. Our expertise can effectively measure attitudes, research pricing, gather facts (e.g. the census), and much more. We specialize in handling relatively large sample sizes to query.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="tabs-2">
			<p>One to one interviews with respondents is a more traditional forms of market research, whereby you essentially deliver the survey in person, but in return you get richer, more nuanced answers. We can help you in excavating into a specific issue deeply, searching for customer problems, understanding psychological motivations and underlying perceptions, etc. We consider interviews as one of our very specialised skillset knowing how to interact with your candidate, how you ask the question, order them, respond to them etc. having a direct effect on how they answer and respond.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="tabs-3">
			<p>Focus groups involve getting a group of people together in a room (usually physically, although technology is making virtual, or online focus groups more feasible). We find the people which fit a target demographic depending on the product or service in question. An experienced moderator will guide the discussion, with a goal of getting participants to discuss the topic among themselves, bouncing thoughts off of one another in a natural group setting.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="tabs-4">
			<p>The greatest benefit of this technique is that we can measure actual behaviour, as opposed to user-reported behaviour. Taking observation more seriously, we consider all methods, from A/B Testing different value propositions, Usability Testing, Eye Tracking, Contextual Inquiry, Mystery Shoppers to checking heatmaps so you understand what people are interested in at a granular level. Engaged together we provide a rich and detailed look at people’s behaviour around your product, which you can use to make further development decisions. Observational research is a direct reflection of “real life,” so these insights are reliable and useful.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="tabs-5">
			<p>Experiments and field trials involve scientific testing, where specific variables and hypotheses can be tested.  These tests can be conducted in controlled environments or out in the field (natural settings). We have a unique approach, which observes cause and affects relationship. We can help pilot test new products and research applications in product driven markets. Observing people and your product in real life can offer invaluable qualitative and quantitative feedback that will help you shape your decisions.</p>
